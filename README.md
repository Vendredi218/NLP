# Intro #
This repository contains my attemps in text mining with NLP technologies.

## event_extraction ##
This project extract information from social media texts.

## cluster_group.py ##
This project clusters the results extracted from raw data

## Sentiment Analysis ##
Use deep learning methods like LSTM model to classify the text. However, results are not quite good; accordingly, I am still learning some basic knowledge about deep learning instead of continuely spending time on this project
